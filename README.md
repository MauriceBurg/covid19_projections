# COVID-19 Projections Using Machine Learning

Using Youyang Gu's projections to create herd immunity calculator for Philadelphia.

MCIT On-Campus 2021 Winter Hackathon
Project/Team Name: Covid Herd Immunity Calculator
Team Members

Name	Year
Sean McGeehan	2022
Maurice Burger	2022
General Idea - Combine infection estimates with anticipated vaccine distribution rates and use machine learning model to predict heard immunity for the city of Philadelphia. We will be using a database provided by John Hopkins, and use infection estimates from Youyang Gu

Anticipated Stack - What technologies do you anticipate using?
Python Pandas Numpy Sklearn Matplotlib

# README by Youyang Gu

[covid19-projections.com](https://covid19-projections.com/), created by [Youyang Gu](https://youyanggu.com/)

**2020-11-19 Update:** We have uploaded our raw US infection estimates in the [`infection_estimates`](/infection_estimates) directory. For a slimmed down version that only has the latest infection estimates, visit [this repository](https://github.com/youyanggu/covid19-infection-estimates-latest).

**2020-10-06 Update:** Projections dated 2020-10-04 was our last model update. For more information, read [Youyang Gu's blog post](https://youyanggu.com/blog/six-months-later). Follow [@youyanggu](https://twitter.com/youyanggu) on Twitter for continued COVID-19 insights.

We take a data-driven approach rooted in epidemiology to forecast infections and deaths for the COVID-19 / coronavirus epidemic in the US and around the world.

* [`tests_target`](/tests_target) - Testing targets for every region based on our forecasts

The underlying SEIR simulator used to generate these projections is open source: https://github.com/youyanggu/yyg-seir-simulator. The simulator repository also includes the best learned values of [the various parameters](https://github.com/youyanggu/yyg-seir-simulator#parameters) for every region.

Our projections are featured on the [CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/forecasting-us.html).

We have also open-sourced our evaluation of our model and other CDC models: https://github.com/youyanggu/covid19-forecast-hub-evaluation.
